* Grid Container
  * Establish the grid formatting context
  * Manages how its direct child elements are spaced, sized and aligned.
  * We create a grid container by declaring display: grid or display: inline-grid on an element. As soon as we do this all direct children of that element will become grid items.

* Grid Item
  * The direct children of a grid container
  * There can be any number of grid items in a grid container

* Grid Line: grid line divides the container's space into rows and columns

* Grid Track: The space between two adjacent grid lines (the columns and rows of the grid)
