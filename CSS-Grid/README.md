* Grid Container
  * Establish the grid formatting context
  * Manages how its direct child elements are spaced, sized and aligned.
  * We create a grid container by declaring display: grid or display: inline-grid on an element. As soon as we do this all direct children of that element will become grid items.

* Grid Item
  * The direct children of a grid container
  * There can be any number of grid items in a grid container

* Grid Line: grid line divides the container's space into rows and columns

* Grid Track: The space between two adjacent grid lines (the columns and rows of the grid)

* Implicit grid: When you create a grid layout with the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties, you are defining what's called an "explicit grid". What happens if there are too many grid items to fit inside the grid you defined? To handle this uncertainty, Grid Layout provides an "implicit grid." The implicit grid is automatically generated by the grid container to position any extra items outside of the explicit grid.

* Control Implicit Tracks
  * grid-auto-rows controls implicit row tracks
  * grid-auto-column controls implicit column tracks

* Line based placement
  * grid-column-start and grid-row-start specify the line where the item begins
  * grid-column-end and grid-row-end specify where the item ends
  * short-hand: grid-column: start / end,  grid-row: start / end
  * You can also use span to specify how many rows or columns to span.
    * grid-row: span 2 / 3
